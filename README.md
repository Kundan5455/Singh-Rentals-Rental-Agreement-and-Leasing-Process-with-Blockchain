If you are planning to learn solidity for basic smart contrats and are amazed by your own code working properly. You should definatly try this.
This was my Final year project and I Pposted it too late because i was not that confident about the same. 
But then I realized its nothing to worry if it is not yet Completed , its nothing to worry if the front and backend dont work together.
Atleast I can Show the world about my final year project.

So Lets start with it !..

Firstly I started reading a lot of research papers and evrything about blockhain and ethereum smart contracts.
So i started earning solidity from Udemy and other Online platforms its not that difficult but bit tricky to understand it properly.

The Best IDE for to run solidity code is the Remix IDE. Provided byt the ethereum Platform Itself.
Slowly I was able to create tiny contracts and was able to initiate the payments in it.

I have used the Rinkbey test ethereum network for the sake of real transactions and catching the records for the same.
Also the main reason to use Rinkbey Test Network was the test ethers were eaisly accessible.
